## Install Applications

You need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Set up Local environment

There are Dockerfile template of local environment on [GitHub](https://github.com/sushat4692/docker-lamp).

### Initial setting up

Open Terminal, and run following commands.

```bash
# Creating Developing Directory
mkdir ~/Virtual

# Anywhere is OK, move to your favorite place
# For example, into your user directory
cd ~/

# Getting datas from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/sushat4692/docker-lamp.git

# Move to downloaded directory
cd docker-lamp

# Duplicate `.env.sample` to `.env`
cp .env.sample .env
```

```bash
# Up (Build and Start) containers
./command.sh up

# Start containers
./command.sh start

# Stop containers
./command.sh stop

# Delete containers, images and volumes

### How to change PHP versions

This docker setting is able to change PHP version by the following command:

```bash
./command.sh up {version number}
```

so, for example if you want to run PHP 8.1:

```bash
./command.sh up 81
```

## After that

After you setting up, you can use local environment and it's related localhost to `~/Virtual`.

```
http://foo.localhost/ -> ~/Virtual/foo/htdocs
http://bar.localhost/ -> ~/Virtual/bar/htdocs
```
