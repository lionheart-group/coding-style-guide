# Compress Video Files

## Estimated Size

- **Audio-less videos to display as background images (with emphasis on loading speed)**
  - Recommended file size: **1MB or less (ideal) to 3MB maximum**
  - Note: Loading speed is critical. Since these videos impact the initial page load, they must be kept as lightweight as possible.
- **Audio-enabled videos that play on click**
  - Recommended file size: **Approximately 5MB to 20MB**
  - Note: Since these videos are loaded via user interaction, slightly larger sizes are acceptable. Depending on the video length, aim for under 20MB for videos lasting 2 minutes or less.

   - Framerate (FPS): Same as source
4. Under the "Audio" tab, ensure that the audio codec is set to AAC with a bitrate of 128 kbps.
