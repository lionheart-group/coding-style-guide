# Exporting rules

We need to think about the loading speed, and the image's quality. so, we need to think what format is the best for each image.

## For supporting high resolution display

- We should export SVG image for Logo, Icon and such as simple path images
  - If those images are not created by Vector images, please let designers to know
  - If there is no Vector images, we should export 2x images of JPG/PNG
- Smaller than 600px in design data, we should export 2x images of JPG/PNG
- If the images are same ratio with PC and SP designs, we should use same image
- If we need to use separated image for PC/SP, we should use `<picture>` tag for it
  - Please see [Embed flexible image](/docs/html/tips/picture#condition-by-image-format)

## Image format

### JPEG <small>(.jpg)</small>

- JPEG format is using a lossy compression method, and not support transparency color.
- If the image has a lot of colors, JPG compression makes it smaller than PNG compression, so you should choose JPG format.
- You should export JPG images with quality **80% (0.8)**, unless you have special reason.

### PNG <small>(.png)</small>

> You should choose PNG format when you need translucent expression.

- PNG format is using lossless compression method, and support transparency color.
- Recently, PNG format supported animation also (APNG), but several browsers are not supporting APNG format yet.

### SVG <small>(.svg)</small>

> You should use SVG format for the graphics made by combination of simple paths (e.g. Logo, Icon)

- SVG format is vector-based graphics unlike other format, so SVG format does NOT lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized
- SVG has gradation functions but it's not supported on some of browser yet
- When SVG file has complex paths data, there is a possibility to effect to browser performance

:::caution

When you export SVG image, be careful about "text" element. If it's included, convert to path before exporting.

:::

### Webp <small>(.webp)</small>

- WebP format is modern format that provides lossless and lossy compression for images on the web.
- Can't export from XD directly, so please convert JPEG/PNG/GIF to WebP through [`convert:webp` task runner](/docs/html/task-runner/scripts/convert-webp).

:::info

Please add WebP image for each embed images except for SVG through `<picture>` tag. Please see how to put [Embed flexible image](/docs/html/tips/picture#condition-by-image-format).

:::

### Other format

:::caution

We won't use the following format.

:::

#### GIF <small>(.gif)</small>

- GIF format is also using lossless compression method.
- GIF format is able to include only transparent color, not translucent color.
<!-- * We won't use GIF format basically, but if you need GIF animation you can choose this. -->
