# Embed flexible image

`<picture>` and `<source>` are able to provide flexible image by several conditions.

## Condition by window width

You can add condition by adding `media` attribute to `<source>` tag.

```html
<picture>
    <!-- Under 750px width window -->
    <source media="(max-width: 750px)" srcset="path/to/sp-image.jpg">
    <!-- Default image -->
    <img src="path/to/pc-image.jpg">
</picture>
```
