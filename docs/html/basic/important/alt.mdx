# Alt attribute of img tag

- **You MUST put `alt` attribute** to every `img` tag
- If the image has text, **you should use the text as the `alt` attribute**
  - If you can't copy the text from the design (e.g. text in an image), **you should inform the designer or the project director** to provide the text
- If the image is purely decorative, **you can use `alt=""`** to indicate that it doesn't convey any information

:::info REASON

- **Accessibility**: Screen readers use the `alt` text to describe the image to visually impaired users.
- **Fallback**: If the image can't load (broken link, slow connection), the `alt` text is displayed instead, so users still understand the content.
- **SEO**: Search engines use the `alt` text to understand the image, which can help your website rank better in search results.

:::warning TIPS

Why you should avoid `alt="image"` or `alt="filename.jpg"`:

- It doesn't provide any useful information to users or search engines
- It's redundant because the `img` tag already indicates that it's an image
- Use descriptive text that conveys the content or function of the image.

Why you should put `alt=""` for decorative images:

- It tells screen readers that the image is purely decorative and doesn't convey any information
- It prevents screen readers from reading out unnecessary information to visually impaired users
  - If the img tag doesn't have alt attribute, screen readers will read out the filename or the URL of the image
