# About Methodologies

:::warning WARNING

There are different rules from the old version. Please see the reference migration guide. [Migrations from Old rules](/docs/html/methodologies/migrations)

:::

Basically, We'll follow [FLOCSS](https://github.com/hiloki/flocss/blob/master/README_eng) CSS methodologies, and we have the enhanced rules.

## Enhanced rules

Originally in FLOCSS rules, `Project` is defined combination of `Component`, but we define that has own each page style.

And, originally, `Component` should make a small part, but the small component is not so useful in the case of "Web site". so, we define `Component` that **the element that included in multiple pages**.

## SCSS directory structure

We prepare the directory structure same with FLOCSS basic rules.

```
- scss
  ├ foundation/
  ├ layout/
  └ object/
      ├ component/
      ├ project/
      └ utility/
```

## Important points

We prepared several limitations, please see the following links.

- [File name and Class name](/docs/html/methodologies/important/name)
- [Don't include other component](/docs/html/methodologies/important/child)
- [Don't use tag selector](/docs/html/methodologies/important/selector)
- [Place of media query](/docs/html/methodologies/important/media_query)
