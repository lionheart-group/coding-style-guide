# Utility

> Utility classes define small and simple styles used to adjust minimal style changes that are difficult to or not appropriate to define in the Object modifiers of Component and Project layer.
>
> Utility classes can prevent Object modifiers in the Component and Project layer from increasing inexhaustibly. In addition, Utility classes can be used to apply margins such as `.mbs { margin-bottom: 10px; }` that the Object itself should not hold.
>
> In addition, helper classes that define the rule sets such as the clearfix technique should also be included in this layer.

You must use `.u-` prefix for Utility.
