## Keyboard settings

If you used to use VSCode, maybe you will be confused to use this app because some shortcuts are different with VSCode.

But, PHPStorm has template keymap that is similar with VSCode, so if you use it, it's able to close to VSCode by that.

1. Open preference (`âŒ˜ + ,`)
2. Select "Keymap" from left nav
3. Select "VSCode (macOS)" on pulldown menu
4. (optional) Change keymap settings
5. Click "OK" (blue button) at right-bottom of window
