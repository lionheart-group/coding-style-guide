## Install Applications

You need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).


## Install docker image

1. Download [general template](https://github.com/sushat4692/docker-lamp) to somewhere you want
2. Duplicate ".env.sample" to ".env" in same directory
3. Run "docker-compose up" inside of the above source directory
4. You can access through the browser


### Set up local environment

Open Terminal, and run following commands.

```bash
# Creating Developing Directory
mkdir ~/Virtual

# Running Docker command
cd path/to/docker # where you download docker template
docker-compose up
```


## After that

After you install these, you can create local environment and it's related localhost to `~/Virtual`.

```
http://foo.localhost/ -> ~/Virtual/foo/htdocs
http://bar.localhost/ -> ~/Virtual/bar/htdocs
```
