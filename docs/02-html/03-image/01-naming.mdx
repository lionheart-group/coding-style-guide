## Basically rules

* You should be lower case, unless you have special reason.
* You must not use full width character(e.g. Japanese character).
* When you partition filename by words, you should use `"-"`, not "_".
* You must not use words that associated temporary meanings, because we're using version control tool.
  * e.g. bu, backup, 20160101, Copy of ~, and so on.

:::note
If each page has the same purpose images, you should make it as the same name.  

**e.g.) Background image of main visual**  
Don't make it "bg-visual-about.jpg", "bg-visual-company.jpg". You should make it "bg-visual.jpg" for all the pages.
