# Creating Page

When you create a static page, please create `page` by WordPress admin page, and prepare page-`{slug}`.php template file.


## Sub page template

LH WordPress Template is implemented function to support tested page template like the following.

```
http://example.com/parent/child/
 -> page-parent__child.php
```

so, if you need to create sub page, please follow this template file name.

:::caution
In case of the above url, `page-child.php` is also valid. but, please use the file name that is included parent slug name e.g. `page-parent__child.php`, because easier to find the page template from the url structure, and if you need to use same slug name to different parent, it's able to separate template file.
