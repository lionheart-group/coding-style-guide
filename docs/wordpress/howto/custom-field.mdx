WordPress is prepared only one WYSIWYG field, but mostly our WordPress project is needed to prepare other input fields for easier to updating the website by using WordPress. so, we need to prepare additional input fields by adding Custom Field.

Mostly, we're using plugins for managing custom field, so please check the following plugin pages.
