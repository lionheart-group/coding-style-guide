# Git

We're managing our project source code by [GitHub](https://github.com/).

When you download/upload to GitHub, you need to use Git command.

## Installation

### For macOS

You can install Git command through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

**Homebrew**

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

**Git**

After installing Homebrew.

```bash
brew install git
```

### For Windows

You can install Git command through [Scoop](https://scoop.sh).

**Scoop**

```bash
Invoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.scoop.sh')

# or shorter
iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
```

**Git**

After installing Scoop.

```bash
scoop install git
```

## Advanced

Git is able to make diff between target branches or commits. By using it, you can prepare the file list that was changed between branches or commits.

If you're using [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) (Default shell of macOS), you can add the following function to your `~/.zshrc` file.

```shell
# Create diffrence files between current with specified commit
# git_diff ${commit_no}
function git_diff() {
    git diff $1 --diff-filter=ACMR --name-only | sed -e 's/\(^.*$\)/"\1"/g' | xargs git archive --format=zip --prefix=_diff/ HEAD -o _diff.zip
}
```

If you're using [Fish](https://fishshell.com/), you can add the following function to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file. **(I haven't check this works properly yet, so if it's not working, please let me know)**

```shell
# Create diffrence files between current with specified commit
# git_diff ${commit_no}
function git_diff
    git diff $argv[1] --diff-filter=ACMR --name-only | sed -e 's/\(^.*$\)/"\1"/g' | xargs git archive --format=zip --prefix=_diff/ HEAD -o _diff.zip
end
```

After adding the function, you can use `git_diff` command to create a zip file that contains the difference between the current branch and the specified commit.

```shell
git_diff ${commit_no}

# Example usage : compare with the latest commit
git_diff HEAD^
```
