# Controller

## About Controller

### What is a Controller?

Controllers are the basis of the application, as it determines how requests are being handled in HTTP. A Controller is a class file that is named associated with a URI.

URL and Controller are closely related. (see [URL](/docs/fegg/basic/url))

```
http://exaple.com/foo/bar
```

In the example above, the framework will try to find a `bar` function in the controller named **Foo.php** and load it.

If the URL accessed from the given example, it would load in **code/application/Foo.php** given that this file exists.

```php title="code/application/Foo.php"
<?php

class Foo extends Application
{
    function bar(){
        //process here...
    }
}
```

### Class

You should have the same name class and file name, and extends `Application` class.

```php title="code/application/Controller.php"
<?php

class Controller extends Application
{

}
```

### Constructor

You sould call parent(`Application`) class constructor.

```php title="code/application/Controller.php"
<?php

class Controller extends Application
{
    /**
     * Constructor
     */
    function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }
}
```

### Initialize

Fegg have a Initialize method apart from constructor.

It is `__init()` method that called after the constructor.

```php title="code/application/Controller.php"
<?php

class Controller extends Application
{
    /**
     * Initialize
     */
    function __init()
    {
        // inityalize process
    }
}
```

The difference between \_\_init and constructor is that \_\_init is run after make self instance, so **it can use Application method by** `$this`.

:::note

You can omit a initialize.

:::

### Method

Run a second segment name method in URL.

```php title="code/application/Controller.php"
<?php

class Controller extends Application
{
    // Run this function by http://example.com/controller/foo
    function foo()
    {
        // any process
    }
}
```

If second segment is empty and you donâ€™t edit basic settings, run the `index()` method.

```php title="code/application/Controller.php"
<?php

class Controller extends Application
{
    // Run this function by http://example.com/controller/index
    //   or http://example.com/controller/
    function index()
    {
        // any process
    }
}
```

:::note

See [Initial settings](/docs/fegg/first/config) about initial method name.

:::

If you want to make a secret method, you should add **underbar(\_)** head of method name.

```php title="code/application/Controller.php"
// http://example.com/controller/_secret
//   -> This URL don't call _secret() method

<?php

class Controller extends Application
{
    // This method is secret from URL dispatcher
    function _secret()
    {
        // any process
    }
}
```

### Arguments

Third segment later are passed to a method.

```php title="code/application/Controller.php"
<?php

class Controller extends Application
{
    // $param will be assigned "bar"
    //   by http://example.com/controller/foo/bar
    function foo( $param )
    {
        echo $param; // bar
    }
}
```

Third segment later are all passed.

```php title="code/application/Controller.php"
<?php

class Controller extends Application
{
    // $param1 will be "bar" and $param2 will be "baz"
    //   by http://example.com/controller/foo/bar/baz
    function foo( $param1, $param2 )
    {
        echo $param1; // bar
        echo $param2; // baz
    }
}
```

## Template of Controller class

```php title="code/application/Index.php"
<?php
/**
 * Index Class
 * // This file name should be Index.php
 */
class Index extends Application
{
    /**
     * Constructor
     */
    function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    /**
     * Initialize progress
     * This method run after making self instance.
     * So, it can use Application class method, for example "$this->in()".
     * It is the difference between __init and construct.
     * If this method is nothing, initializing progress is omitted.
     */
    function __init()
    {
    }

    /**
     * Common progress
     * If you add the underbar(_) head of method name, it be internal method.
     * So, it can't called by URL dispatcher.
     */
    function _common()
    {
    }

    /**
     * Default page display method
     * If you input only class name URL, run this method.
     * It is not necessary, but recommend be that default page display method name is index.
     */
    function index()
    {
        // Common progress
        $this->_common();

        // Display compiled template
        $this->displayPage('index');
    }
}
/* End Of File: Index.php */
```
