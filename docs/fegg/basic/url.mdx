# URL

## URL and Controller class

Fegg FW also adopted the segment-based-approach. Here is how the URL and Controller class relationship work.

```
http://example.com/class/function/param1/param2...
```

1. Class of Controller
2. Method of Controller class
3. Arguments for Method

You can have a more flexible URL by setting up your URL structure in [Routing](#routing) file.

## Example

```bash title="URL"
http://example.com/post/edit/1
```

```php title="Running method"
<?php
// code/application/Post.php

class Post extends Application
{

    // ...

    public function edit( $id )
    {
        echo $id; // Result: 1
    }

    // ...

}
```

## Routing

You can set your URL structure without URL and Controller class relation by configuring your route file.

You may set your `$route` in array in **code/config/route.php**.

```php
$route['from'] = 'to';
```

As described above, the Key of array is a segment of URL, whereas the Value of array is the value after remapping.

:::note
Routes will run in order when they are defined. Higher routes will always take precedence over lower ones.

### Wildcards

There are 2 types of available wildcards (`:any`, `:num`) you may use before mapping key.

`:any` is **any types of words**. `:num` is **limited only numbers**.


### Example

```php title="code/config/route.php"
<?php

$route['foo'] = 'bar';
// http://example.com/foo -> code/application/Bar.php

$route['item/:any'] = 'product/item_lookup/$1';
// http://example.com/item/foobar -> code/application/Product.php -> Product::item_lookup( 'foobar' )

$route['archive/edit/:num'] = 'post/edit/$1';
// http://example.com/archive/edit/1 -> code/application/Post.php -> Post::edit( 1 )

$route['news/post_:num.html'] = 'news/detail/$1';
// http://example.com/news/post_1.html -> code/application/News.php -> News::detail( 1 )
```
